## Description

Design an API based on mini challenges from the Combine:
Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
Data Validation is required.

Endpoints:

1. Magic 8 Ball: create a endpoint generates 8 unique responses. One controller
2. Guess It: create 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.

Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100

3. Restaurant Picker: create 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.

Things to turn in:

- Project, zipped
- Github link in comments
- Don't forget the peer review!
